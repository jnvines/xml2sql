xml2sql
=======

This will be a general xml to sql conversion program.


The general idea will be:

 - Convey some sort of mapping of nodes/attributes to a table format. 
 	? Check for duplicates. First versions will assume you know how to use sql. later features will include auto import to database of your choosing 
 - Output file structure based on nodes and attributes.
